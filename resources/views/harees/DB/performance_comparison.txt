PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: OLD VS NEW STRUCTURE
============================================

1. GLOBAL SEARCH (e.g., Searching for "Gold Ring")
--------------------------------------------------
OLD STRUCTURE: VERY SLOW
- The database has to look inside EVERY category table separately.
- If you have 20 categories, it runs 20 separate searches and glues the results together.
- Speed: Decreases significantly as you add more categories.
- Estimated Time: 100ms - 500ms+ (depending on data size and number of tables).

NEW STRUCTURE: INSTANT (FAST)
- The database looks in ONE `products` table.
- It uses the `idx_search` index to jump straight to the results.
- Speed: Stays fast even if you have millions of products.
- Estimated Time: < 10ms.

2. FILTERING (e.g., "Show all items under $500")
------------------------------------------------
OLD STRUCTURE: SLOW
- Again, it must check 18kdgold_product_anklets, then 18kdgold_product_bangles, etc.
- It cannot use a global price index because prices are scattered across many tables.

NEW STRUCTURE: FAST
- Uses the `idx_price` index on the main table.
- Instantly picks the rows that match the price range.

3. ADDING A NEW CATEGORY
------------------------
OLD STRUCTURE: COMPLEX & RISKY
- You must create a new physical table (e.g., `CREATE TABLE 18kdgold_product_watches...`).
- You must update your backend code (PHP/Laravel) to know about this new table.
- You must update your search queries to include this new table.

NEW STRUCTURE: ZERO DOWNTIME
- You simply add one row to the `categories` table.
- No code changes required.
- No database structure changes required.

4. DATABASE SIZE & CACHING
--------------------------
OLD STRUCTURE: INEFFICIENT
- MySQL has to keep open file handles for every single table.
- Caching is less effective because data is fragmented.

NEW STRUCTURE: OPTIMIZED
- MySQL optimizes the single `products` table heavily.
- Frequently accessed data stays in memory (RAM).

CONCLUSION
----------
The New Structure is roughly 10x to 100x faster for search and filtering operations, and infinitely easier to maintain.
